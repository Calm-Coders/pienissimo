# OI-49 - WooCommerce checkout-link flow

A workstream decided on 31 July. The tutor generates a checkout URL from the
Opportunity carrying `sf_opp_id`; a WooCommerce mu-plugin
(`sf-opportunity-tracker.php`) stores it as order meta `_sf_opportunity_id` and
exposes it via REST as `sf_opportunity_id`; Salesforce reads the order, writes
back, and moves the Opportunity to Closed Won. Spec:
`Integrazione_Salesforce_WooCommerce.docx` (Sabatino Rinaldi, 31/07).

**Pull versus webhook is CLOSED: webhooks.**

📅 **The technical meeting is scheduled: Thursday 27 August 2026, 10:00–11:30** —
_"integrazione tecnica con WooCommerce tramite Webhook, comprensiva dello
scambio di credenziali"_. Invited: Aurel Mrruku, Andrea Di Cicco, Sabatino
Rinaldi. (Earlier notes said 26 August; the invitation says the 27th.)

**One of the two open decisions is now closed.** Elena Spini's
`PIENISSIMO - Project Status` document (6 August) states **"I coupon sono
esclusi dalla prima fase"** — so the negotiated-price-via-dynamic-coupon option
is out for phase 1, leaving the **WooCommerce listino** as the price source of
truth. Still open: whether the opportunity id travels **in clear or as a signed
token**.

The same document pins the sale-origin discriminator, which had been loose:
**"da palco"** is identified by the **product code on the WooCommerce order**;
**"recall tutor"** by a **mandatory field on the Opportunity** the tutor must
fill before generating the link. That field is the one carried by
[OI-70](OI-70%20Performance%20Plus%20opportunity%20typing.md).

**Partly built, unrecorded.** `Product2.WooCommerce_Product_Id__c` and
`Opportunity.WooCommerce_Order_Id__c` were both committed in early August,
after the org check that said neither existed —
[the build ahead of the record](../objects/The%20build%20ahead%20of%20the%20record.md).
Still to do: the link-generator button with product and quantity pickers, the
pre-filled email template, the joint PHP call, and an end-to-end test.
