# OI-49 - WooCommerce checkout-link flow

A workstream decided on 31 July. The tutor generates a checkout URL from the
Opportunity carrying `sf_opp_id`; a WooCommerce mu-plugin
(`sf-opportunity-tracker.php`) stores it as order meta `_sf_opportunity_id` and
exposes it via REST as `sf_opportunity_id`; Salesforce reads the order, writes
back, and moves the Opportunity to Closed Won. Spec:
`Integrazione_Salesforce_WooCommerce.docx` (Sabatino Rinaldi, 31/07).

**Pull versus webhook is CLOSED: webhooks.** Credential exchange and payload
testing start **26 August**.

**Two decisions remain open** and were not discussed on 2026-08-06: the **price
source of truth** — WooCommerce listino versus the Salesforce negotiated price
via dynamic one-shot coupons — and whether the opportunity id travels **in
clear or as a signed token**. Elena Spini's flag that requirements were not
frozen at end of July still stands.

**Partly built, unrecorded.** `Product2.WooCommerce_Product_Id__c` and
`Opportunity.WooCommerce_Order_Id__c` were both committed in early August,
after the org check that said neither existed —
[the build ahead of the record](../objects/The%20build%20ahead%20of%20the%20record.md).
Still to do: the link-generator button with product and quantity pickers, the
pre-filled email template, the joint PHP call, and an end-to-end test.
